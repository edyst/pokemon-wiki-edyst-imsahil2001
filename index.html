						Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer
					</h4>

					<ol style="list-style-type: number">
						<li>
							<h4 class="heading-3">What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									We&#39;re sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you
									know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential
									for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the
									rodent&#39;s evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has
									an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast
									amounts of electricity. Maybe you&#39;ve bumped into this
									species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all
									Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.
								</li>
								<li>Answer is Raichu</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="heading-3">
								What&#39;s the most effective Poke Ball in the game?
							</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There&#39;s the basic
									model you start your journey off with, but progressive
									upgrades are needed if you&#39;re looking to keep up with some
									of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If
									you&#39;ve made your way through any Pokemon game, you&#39;ve
									reached the point where you&#39;re presented with the most
									effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch,
									and no button mashing at all is required.

								<li>Answer is Master Ball</li>
